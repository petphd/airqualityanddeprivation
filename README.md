# airqualityanddeprivation

This project is a requirement for my PhD training. I decided to analyse whether air quality and deprivation in Liverpool City region have any association.

All of the data used in this project comes from open sources. The data was taken from CDRC website (https://data.cdrc.ac.uk/). Datesets that I am using in this project are Index of Multiple Deprivation (2019) and Access to Healthy Assets & Hazards (AHAH)(2022)

The code aims to uncover and analyse a potential relationship between air quality and deprivation index, with the help of statistical modelling and visualisations.
